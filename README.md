A flexible P2P networking library for upgradable distributed systems. The core mission of `airwave` is to provide a simple P2P interface that can support a wide variety of different algorithms, with a focus on backwards compatible. The P2P interface supports:

- Peer discovery
- Casting (send to one)
- Multicasting (send to many)
- Broadcasting (send to everyone)
